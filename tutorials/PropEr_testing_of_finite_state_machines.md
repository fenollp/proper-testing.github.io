In this tutorial we will use PropEr to test a finite state machine
specification. The testcases produced using the PropEr fsm library
(`proper_fsm`) are of exactly the same form as the testcases produced
using the PropEr statem library (`proper_statem`). The difference lies in
the way the callback modules are specified. Before reading this
tutorial, please make sure you have understood the basic concepts of
testing stateful systems with PropEr, as described
[here](PropEr_testing_of_generic_servers.html) and
[here](PropEr_testing_of_process_interaction.html).

PropEr fsm offers a convenient way to test systems exhibiting a finite state
machine behaviour. That is, systems that can be modeled as a finite
collection of named states and transitions between them. A typical finite
state machine representation of a system is the state diagram. PropEr fsm is
designed to bring the callback module specification very close to a state
diagram.


A finite state machine example
------------------------------

Consider the following state diagram that describes the life of a strange
creature that feeds on cheese, grapes and lettuce but never eats the same kind
of food on two consecutive days.

![State Diagram of creature's behaviour](
    ../img/creature.png "Creature's behaviour"
)


As we can see from the state diagram, days are categorized into `cheese_days`,
`lettuce_days` and `grapes_days`. On a `cheese_day` the creature eats only
cheese, on a `lettuce_day` only lettuce and so on. When it gets hungry, it
consumes a fixed portion of the daily food, which is kept in the food storage.
To make life less boring and, more importantly, to bring food to the storage,
the creature goes shopping from time to time. Finally, every night it decides
what to eat the next day. There is only one rule regarding this decision:
"never eat the same food for two days in a row".

Being a huge fan of Erlang, this creature has implemented a finite state
machine describing its daily routine using the OTP `gen_fsm` behaviour. The
internal state of the finite state machine is a record that represents the food
storage. The record fields contain the quantity of food that is currently
stored.

{% highlight erlang %}
-type quantity() :: non_neg_integer().

-record(storage, {cheese  = 5 :: quantity(),
                  lettuce = 5 :: quantity(),
                  grapes  = 5 :: quantity()}).
{% endhighlight %}

Let us now describe the API of the finite state machine:

*   We can start the finite state machine by specifying the kind of day on
    which it will be started.

      {% highlight erlang %}
      -type day() :: 'cheese_day' | 'lettuce_day' | 'grapes_day'.

      -spec start(day()) -> {'ok', pid()} | {'error', {'already_started', pid()}}.
      start(Day) ->
          gen_fsm:start({local, creature}, ?MODULE, [Day], []).

      init([Day]) ->
          {ok, Day, #storage{}}.
      {% endhighlight %}

*   We can simulate the condition when the creature is hungry. The function
    `hungry/0` will return us the quantity of available food at the moment
    when the creature is ready to start eating.

      {% highlight erlang %}
      -type food_left() :: 'cheese_left' | 'lettuce_left' | 'grapes_left'.

      -spec hungry() -> {food_left(), quantity()}.
      hungry() ->
          gen_fsm:sync_send_event(creature, eat).

      cheese_day(eat, Caller, #storage{cheese = Cheese} = S) ->
          gen_fsm:reply(Caller, {cheese_left, Cheese}),
          {next_state, cheese_day, S#storage{cheese = Cheese - 1}}.

      lettuce_day(eat, Caller, #storage{lettuce = Lettuce} = S) ->
          gen_fsm:reply(Caller, {lettuce_left, Lettuce}),
          {next_state, lettuce_day, S#storage{lettuce = Lettuce - 1}}.

      grapes_day(eat, Caller, #storage{grapes = Grapes} = S) ->
          gen_fsm:reply(Caller, {grapes_left, Grapes}),
          {next_state, grapes_day, S#storage{grapes = Grapes - 1}}.
      {% endhighlight %}

*   We can simulate the situation when the creature goes shopping to buy some
    new food.

      {% highlight erlang %}
      -spec buy(food(), quantity()) -> 'ok'.
      buy(Food, Quantity) ->
          gen_fsm:send_event(creature, {store, Food, Quantity}).
      cheese_day({store, Food, Quantity}, S) ->
          case Food of
              cheese ->
                  {next_state, cheese_day,
                   S#storage{cheese = S#storage.cheese + Quantity}};
              lettuce ->
                  {next_state, cheese_day,
                   S#storage{lettuce = S#storage.lettuce + Quantity}};
              grapes ->
                  {next_state, cheese_day,
                   S#storage{grapes = S#storage.grapes + Quantity}}
          end;
      lettuce_day({store, Food, Quantity}, S) ->
          case Food of
              cheese ->
                  {next_state, lettuce_day,
                   S#storage{cheese = S#storage.cheese + Quantity}};
              lettuce ->
                  {next_state, lettuce_day,
                   S#storage{lettuce = S#storage.lettuce + Quantity}};
              grapes ->
                  {next_state, lettuce_day,
                   S#storage{grapes = S#storage.grapes + Quantity}}
          end;
      grapes_day({store, Food, Quantity}, S) ->
          case Food of
              cheese ->
                  {next_state, grapes_day,
                   S#storage{cheese = S#storage.cheese + Quantity}};
              lettuce ->
                  {next_state, grapes_day,
                   S#storage{lettuce = S#storage.lettuce + Quantity}};
              grapes ->
                  {next_state, grapes_day,
                   S#storage{grapes = S#storage.grapes + Quantity}}
          end;
      {% endhighlight %}

Note that we will add more clauses to these functions (see below)
hence the semicolons at the end of these clauses.

*   Last but not least, we can simulate the beginning of a new day by
    specifying the creature's food for that day.

      {% highlight erlang %}
      -spec new_day(food()) -> 'ok'.
      new_day(Food) ->
          gen_fsm:send_event(creature, {new_day, Food}).

      cheese_day({new_day, lettuce}, S) ->
          {next_state, lettuce_day, S};
      cheese_day({new_day, grapes}, S) ->
          {next_state, grapes_day, S}.

      lettuce_day({new_day, cheese}, S) ->
          {next_state, cheese_day, S};
      lettuce_day({new_day, grapes}, S) ->
          {next_state, grapes_day, S}.

      grapes_day({new_day, cheese}, S) ->
          {next_state, cheese_day, S};
      grapes_day({new_day, lettuce}, S) ->
          {next_state, lettuce_day, S}.
      {% endhighlight %}

### The property to test ###

Properties for testing finite state machine specifications are very
similar to those we have seen in the PropEr statem tutorials. The
difference is that the functions `commands/1` and `run_commands/2` are
now imported from `proper_fsm` module. These functions behave similarly
to their `proper_statem` counterparts, only now commands are generated
and executed according to a finite state machine specification.

As a first example, we would like to test that the creature never runs
out of food in the storage.

{% highlight erlang %}
prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies() ->
    ?FORALL(Cmds, proper_fsm:commands(?MODULE),
            begin
                start(cheese_day), %% could also be grapes_day or lettuce_day,
                                   %% but the same kind of day should be used
                                   %% to initialize the model state
                {History, State, Result} = proper_fsm:run_commands(?MODULE, Cmds),
                stop(),
                ?WHENFAIL(io:format("History: ~w~nState: ~w\nResult: ~w~n",
                                    [History, State, Result]),
                          Result =:= ok)
            end).
{% endhighlight %}

## Defining the PropEr finite state machine

### State representation ###

Following the convention used in `gen_fsm` behaviour, the model state is
separated into a _state name_ and some _state data_. The _state name_ is used to
denote a state of the finite state machine and the _state data_ is any relevant
information that has to be stored in the model state. States are fully
represented as tuples `{StateName, StateData}`.

Splitting the model state into _state name_ and _state data_ makes the states
of the fsm more explicit and allows the specification to be closer to a state
diagram of the system under test. The `proper_statem:command/1`
generator is replaced by a collection of callback functions, one for each
reachable state of the fsm. Each callback function is named after the state it
represents and takes the _state data_ as argument.

The state is initialized via the `initial_state/0` and `initial_state_data/0`
callbacks. The former specifies the initial state of the finite state machine,
while the latter specifies what the state data should initially contain.
Let us start on a `cheese_day` with the default portions of each kind of food
available in the storage, since the initial state of our model should coincide
with the initial state of the system under test.

{% highlight erlang %}
initial_state() -> cheese_day.

initial_state_data() -> #storage{}.
{% endhighlight %}

### Specifying transitions ###

In our specification, we will define a separate callback function for each
state in the state diagram (i.e. `cheese_day/1`, `lettuce_day/1`,
`grapes_day/1`). Each of these callbacks should specify a list of possible
transitions from that state.
A _transition_ is a pair consisting of the target state and the symbolic call
that triggers the transition. The atom `history` can be used as target state to
denote that a transition does not change the current state of the fsm.

As we mentioned before, the state callbacks take as argument the state data.
In our case, the state data is a record containing the quantity of cheese,
lettuce and grapes in the food storage.

{% highlight erlang %}
cheese_day(_S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition() ++
        [{grapes_day,  {call,?MODULE,new_day,[grapes]}},
         {lettuce_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[lettuce]}}].

lettuce_day(_S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition() ++
        [{grapes_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[grapes]}},
         {cheese_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[cheese]}}].

grapes_day(_S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition() ++
        [{lettuce_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[lettuce]}},
         {cheese_day,  {call,?MODULE,new_day,[cheese]}}].
{% endhighlight %}

A `store_transition` is triggered every time the creature buys some food,
whereas an `eat_transition` is triggered every time it is hungry.
Both of these transitions do not change the current state of the fsm and
this is specified by having `history` as the target state.

{% highlight erlang %}
store_transition() ->
    [{history, {call,?MODULE,buy,[food(), quantity()]}}].

eat_transition() ->
    [{history, {call,?MODULE,hungry,[]}}].
{% endhighlight %}

We also need to define the generators `food()` and `quantity()`.
A possible definition of them is given below:

{% highlight erlang %}
food() ->
    oneof([cheese, lettuce, grapes]).

quantity() ->
    ?SUCHTHAT(I, pos_integer(), I < 5).
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we could have defined `quantity()` more simply as `range(1,4)`.
Actually, this would have been a better choice here but, just so as to
show how to deal with some possible error situations, let us stick to
this definition for the rest of this tutorial.

At command generation time, the callback function corresponding to the current
state of the finite state machine will be called to return the list of
possible transitions from that state. Then, PropEr will randomly choose a
transition and, according to that, generate the next symbolic call to be
included in the command sequence. By default transitions are chosen with
equal probability, but this behaviour can be fine-tuned, as we will see later.

### The other callback functions ###

Preconditions and postconditions are also imposed on the finite state machine
specification. Only now these callbacks take a slightly different form. Instead
of the _State_ argument that was provided in `proper_statem` callbacks,
the callbacks in `proper_fsm` take into account the origin of a transition
(_From state_), the target of a transition (_Target state_) and the
_state data_.

Initially, let's not have any preconditions.

{% highlight erlang %}
precondition(_From, _Target, _StateData, {call,_,_,_}) ->
    true.
{% endhighlight %}

However, postconditions are needed.

{% highlight erlang %}
postcondition(cheese_day, _, S, {call,_,hungry,[]}, Result) ->
    Cheese = S#storage.cheese,
    Cheese > 0 andalso Result =:= {cheese_left, Cheese};
postcondition(lettuce_day, _, S, {call,_,hungry,[]}, Result) ->
    Lettuce = S#storage.lettuce,
    Lettuce > 0 andalso Result =:= {lettuce_left, Lettuce};
postcondition(grapes_day, _, S, {call,_,hungry,[]}, Result) ->
    Grapes = S#storage.grapes,
    Grapes > 0 andalso Result =:= {grapes_left, Grapes};
postcondition(_From, _Target, _StateData, {call,_,_,_}, Result) ->
    Result =:= ok.
{% endhighlight %}

The set of callback functions corresponding to the states of the fsm update
part of the model state, since they specify the target state of a transition.
In order to update the _state data_, we have to define a separate callback
function.

{% highlight erlang %}
next_state_data(_, _, S, _, {call,_,buy,[Food, Quantity]}) ->
    case Food of
        cheese ->
            S#state{cheese = S#state.cheese + Quantity};
        lettuce ->
            S#state{lettuce = S#state.lettuce + Quantity};
        grapes ->
            S#state{grapes = S#state.grapes + Quantity}
    end;
next_state_data(Today, _, S, _, {call,_,hungry,[]}) ->
    case Today of
        cheese_day ->
            S#state{cheese = S#state.cheese - 1};
        lettuce_day ->
            S#state{lettuce = S#state.lettuce - 1};
        grapes_day ->
            S#state{grapes = S#state.grapes - 1}
    end;
next_state_data(_From, _Target, StateData, _Result, {call,_,_,_}) ->
    StateData.
{% endhighlight %}

## PropEr in action

Let us run the first test on our property. It states that the creature never
runs out of food in the storage.

{% highlight erl %}
5> proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies()).

Error: The transition from "cheese_day" state triggered by
{food_fsm,new_day,1} call leads to multiple target states.
Use the precondition/5 callback to specify which target state should be chosen.
** exception error: too_many_targets
{% endhighlight %}

Well, we didn't see that coming! It seems that some part of our specification
is not proper enough.

PropEr allows more than one transitions to be triggered by the same
symbolic call and lead to different target states. As in this case:

{% highlight erlang %}
cheese_day(_S) ->
    [{grapes_day,  {call,?MODULE,new_day,[grapes]}},
     {lettuce_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[lettuce]}}].
{% endhighlight %}

However, the precondition callback may return true for at most one of these
target states. Otherwise, PropEr will not be able to detect which transition
was chosen and an exception will be raised. In our case, we have to specify
the following preconditions to associate each possible argument of `new_day/1`
with the correct target state.

{% highlight erlang %}
precondition(Day, Day, _, {call,_,new_day,_}) ->
    false;
precondition(_, grapes_day, _, {call,_,new_day,[grapes]}) ->
    true;
precondition(_, cheese_day, _, {call,_,new_day,[cheese]}) ->
    true;
precondition(_, lettuce_day, _, {call,_,new_day,[lettuce]}) ->
    true;
precondition(_, _, _, {call,_,new_day,_}) ->
    false;
precondition(_, _, _, {call,_,_,_}) ->
    true.
{% endhighlight %}

We run the test one more time:

{% highlight erl %}
8> proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies()).
.................................................
Error: Couldn't produce an instance that satisfies all strict constraints after 50 tries.
{error,cant_generate}
{% endhighlight %}

Ooops! Now we have triggered another kind of error.
This error suggests that a `?SUCHTHAT` constraint could not be satisfied with
the default value of 'constraint_tries'. At this point there are two options.
We can either increase the `constraint_tries` limit to e.g. 100 tries by
running

{% highlight erl %}
proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies(), {constraint_tries,100})
{% endhighlight %}

or we can modify the generator that is responsible for this error.
We choose to take the second option so as to eliminate the error permanently.
A `?SUCHTHAT` constraint occurs in the `quantity/0` generator. It was
introduced to control the quantity of food that can be bought in one
transaction. The modified generator may return any positive integer after 50
failing attempts to produce a positive integer less than five.

{% highlight erlang %}
quantity() ->
    ?SUCHTHATMAYBE(I, pos_integer(), I < 5).
{% endhighlight %}

And again we run the test:

{% highlight erl %}
10> proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies()).
....................................................................................................
OK: Passed 100 test(s).
{% endhighlight %}

Finally some results! It seems that there is always some food in the storage.
But... wait a minute! We cannot be sure of what was tested unless we
have a look at the testcase distribution.

{% highlight erlang %}
prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies() ->
    ?FORALL(Cmds, proper_fsm:commands(?MODULE),
            begin
                start(cheese_day), %% could also be grapes_day or lettuce_day,
                                   %% but the same kind of day should be used
                                   %% to initialize the model state
                {History, State, Result} = proper_fsm:run_commands(?MODULE, Cmds),
                stop(),
                ?WHENFAIL(io:format("History: ~w~nState: ~w\nResult: ~w~n",
                                    [History, State, Result]),
                          aggregate(zip(proper_fsm:state_names(History),
                                        command_names(Cmds)),
                          Result =:= ok))
            end).
{% endhighlight %}

The property is now instrumented to collect statistics about how often
each transition was tested. Let's try it:

{% highlight erl %}
12> proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies()).
....................................................................................................
OK: Passed 100 test(s).

20% {cheese_day,{food_fsm,new_day,1}}
14% {grapes_day,{food_fsm,new_day,1}}
14% {lettuce_day,{food_fsm,new_day,1}}
 9% {cheese_day,{food_fsm,hungry,0}}
 9% {cheese_day,{food_fsm,buy,2}}
 8% {lettuce_day,{food_fsm,buy,2}}
 8% {grapes_day,{food_fsm,buy,2}}
 7% {grapes_day,{food_fsm,hungry,0}}
 7% {lettuce_day,{food_fsm,hungry,0}}
true
{% endhighlight %}

It seems that the creature doesn't get hungry very often in our tests.
Thus, our previous conclusion about everlasting food supplies cannot be really
trusted. We can instruct PropEr to choose `hungry/0` calls more often by
assigning weights to transitions. The optional callback `weight/3` serves
exactly this purpose.

`weight(From, Target, Call)` assigns an integer weight to transitions from
`From` state to `Target` state triggered by `Call`. Each transition is now
chosen with probability proportional to the weight assigned.

{% highlight erlang %}
weight(_Today, _Tomorrow, {call,_,new_day,_}) -> 1;
weight(_Today, _Today, {call,_,hungry,_}) -> 3;
weight(_Today, _Today, {call,_,buy,_}) -> 2.
{% endhighlight %}

Running the test with weighted transitions:

{% highlight erl %}

As we can see now, in case of non-stop eating the creature eventually runs out
of food. What is more, the content of the `State` variable reveals that the
quantity of available food starts getting negative values. We will correct the
code to prevent this from happening.

{% highlight erlang %}

    gen_fsm:reply(Caller, {cheese_left, Cheese}),

Let us now assume that the creature is wise enough to take care of
buying food before it gets hungry. This can be modeled by adding the
following precondition.

{% highlight erlang %}
precondition(Today, _, S, {call,_,hungry,[]}) ->
    case Today of
        cheese_day ->
            S#storage.cheese > 0;
        lettuce_day ->
            S#storage.lettuce > 0;
        grapes_day ->
            S#storage.grapes > 0
    end;
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, we would like to mention another, less obvious cause of
`cant_generate` errors: difficult-to-satisfy preconditions. After
failing `constraint_tries` times to generate a symbolic call with a true
precondition, PropEr will report a `cant_generate` error. In our specification,
this is not the case. Nevertheless, we can instruct PropEr to choose an
`eat_transition` only when there is food available.

{% highlight erlang %}
cheese_day(S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition(S#storage.cheese) ++
        [{grapes_day,  {call,?MODULE,new_day,[grapes]}},
         {lettuce_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[lettuce]}}].

lettuce_day(S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition(S#storage.lettuce) ++
        [{grapes_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[grapes]}},
         {cheese_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[cheese]}}].

grapes_day(S) ->
    store_transition() ++ eat_transition(S#storage.lettuce) ++
        [{lettuce_day, {call,?MODULE,new_day,[lettuce]}},
         {cheese_day,  {call,?MODULE,new_day,[cheese]}}].

eat_transition(Food_left) ->
    [{history, {call,?MODULE,hungry,[]}} || Food_left > 0].
{% endhighlight %}

The property now successfully passes 1000 tests.

{% highlight erl %}
17> proper:quickcheck(food_fsm:prop_doesnt_run_out_of_supplies(), 1000).
